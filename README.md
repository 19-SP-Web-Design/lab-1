# Lab  1 - The Basics

HTML's job is to *accurately describe* the web page's content. In this lab, you will generate some content and then describe it with the basic HTML tags that we have learned so far.

## Lab Description

You may choose to **work in pairs** for this lab. As a team, you will only submit one project. Include two meta author tags: (`<meta name="author" content="Eric Kuha">`) or include both names in a comment block at the top of the source file. `<!-- Author: Eric Kuha -->`

Think of a topic of which you believe you are knowledgable. Select one small aspect of it that you can talk about in about five paragraphs. Try to arrange your information so that it requires more than one heading (2-4).

Some possible topics:

* A hobby of yours
* A subject that you are actively researching
* Some aspect of your job.

Now, mark it up with tags. First, paste it into whatever template you're using for a basic HTMl page (doctype declaration, standard meta tags, html, head, and body container elements, etc). Then, add as many tags as you think is necessary to make the text a little more visually interesting. A list of tags you might use:

* `<p>`
* `<em>`
* `<strong>`
* `<h1-6>`
* `<div>`
* `<blockquote>`
* `<hr>` and `<br>`

You are free to use any tags that you have seen in Chapters 1 and 2. You are not required to use CSS, but if you want to experiment with the style elements that we've seen in the examples so far, you are free to do so and if you use them well, there might be some extra credit points for you.

This time, make sure you put your file through the [HTML validator service](https://validator.w3.org/) and ensure that it comes up *error free*. If it's giving you errors that you can't figure out, tell the instructor, who will be totally happy to help you troubleshoot them.

When you are finished, ensure that the file is in the folder for this repository and push it to github.
